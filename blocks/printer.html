<h4>Automation? Yes! Whoop! Whoop!</h4>
<p>With the printer you can automate the creation of the bit blocks.</p>
<p>It will draw bits from the bit storage blocks next to it, but only from the side which are not its front (you need to be able to control it still).</p>
<h4>How to use it, you ask?</h4>
<p>Well simple: Make a sealed pattern, put it with a chisel inside your printer. And fill up the storages with the requested bits of choice!</p>
