### Minecraft mod:
Chisels and Bits is a Minecraft Mod which allows you to cut up the large blocks that make up your world, and place the little cuts back down.
In any way you like.

You want smoother stairs? Go for it.
You want better looking roofs? Or Pillars? It is all possible now.

You can make entirely new looking and feeling blocks by mixing and matching the bits of different already existing blocks.

### Compatibility:
#### Vanilla:
By default, all solid, simple, full cube blocks, like logs, planks, ores, storage blocks (diamond, emerald, iron etc) are supported.
Additionally, some specific blocks are curated by hand, this is especially done for all glass blocks.   

#### Mod:
The scan for compatible blocks automatically also detects all mod blocks which are compatible.
If a mod maker wants to control the selection procedure for his or her blocks, he can do so, by adding them to either one of two tags:
- `chiselsandbits:chiselable/forced` to force the block to be chiselable (handy for glass like blocks)
- `chiselsandbits:chiselable/blocked` to prevent a block that is normally chiselable to be chiseled.

### Rebuild:
As of the 1. of August 2021 this project underwent a massive rebuild and this means that not all features, that you as a player know from older versions, are part of this newly rebuild version.
Additionally, this means that older versions of the mod are not supported anymore, even if they are for an active LTS version of Minecraft.
Sadly we do not have the time or energy to support all the versions we would want.

If you are missing a feature on the new rebuild version, please open a support ticket, after you have searched the already existing issues. Thanks.
