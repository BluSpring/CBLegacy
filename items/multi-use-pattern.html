<h4>These single use patterns keep on breaking! How do I make them last?</h4>
<p>You can apply a sealant to a single use pattern to seal the pattern, which will allow you to use it multiple times.</p>
<p>Hold the sealant in one hand and then apply it to the pattern in your other hand.</p>
<h4>Can I then still modify it?</h4>
<p>No, you sealed your pattern. Writing on sealant seems to be impossible...</p>
