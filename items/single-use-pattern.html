<h4>Have you make a particular block you really want more of?</h4>
<p>Then you can make a simple pattern by writing down the bits you used in a block.</p>
<h4>How do you make it?</h4>
<p>Use a quill together with a piece of paper in the other hand to write down the bits of the chiseled block you are looking at.</p>
<h4>How do I modify it?</h4>
<p>Put it in a modification table to modify it.</p>
<p>You can do modifications like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rotate</li>
    <li>Mirror</li>
</ul>
<h4>How often can I use it?</h4>
Once. You will need to seal it to use it multiple times.
