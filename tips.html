<p>Chisels &amp; Bits has a lot of different features that use useful in cutting down on how much time it takes to design your custom blocks, keep this in mind when you're making something new there's usually more than one way to accomplish something.<p>

<h3>Undo / Redo</h3>
<p>You can undo most bit/chisel operations, creative block destruction included. These commands can be invaluable if your building something and accidentally click on the wrong thing, or make a wrong move.</p>

<h3>Almost every mode and action has a keybinding</h3>
<p>This means that you can bind undo/redo, or specific modes to mouse buttons or keyboard keys allowing you to skip the radial menu and spend more time chiseling</p>

<h3>Holding shift allows you to ignore the block boundaries when placing a chiseled block.</h3>
<p>This lets you combine different parts of various blocks together and work with larger portions without having to build everything in one block.</p>

<h3>Bits and Chisels have many modes</h3>
<p>Depending on what you're doing one mode might be more useful than another, and remembers that the radial menu works for bits, tape measures as well for chisels</p>

<h3>The wrench can modify already chiseled blocks</h3>
<p>In the same way the modification table can modify a pattern for you, the wrench allows you to perform those modifications to chiseled blocks.</p>

<h3>The bit bag allows you to quickly interact with the bit storage</h3>
<p>If you have a lot of bits in a bit bag or just want to pickup leftovers from a storage, right-click or shift-right-click the storage with the bag and the bits are transferred.</p>
